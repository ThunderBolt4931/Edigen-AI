# EdiGen AI 🤖✨
EdiGenAI is a versatile and powerful web application for AI image generation, offering a rich set of features for both beginners and advanced users. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with multiple backend systems, including a sophisticated ComfyUI-based pipeline and a flexible Stable Diffusion-based server.

---
## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional image generation platforms often force users to choose between ease of use and advanced customization.

While diffusion-based interfaces provide accessibility, they frequently lack support for sophisticated workflows such as virtual try-on, localized inpainting, text preservation, and multi-model orchestration. Conversely, highly customizable systems often require significant technical expertise.

EdiGen AI bridges this gap by combining production-grade diffusion pipelines, ComfyUI workflow orchestration, custom model conditioning, and specialized computer vision modules into a unified platform that enables both novice and advanced users to create high-quality AI-generated imagery.

The platform was designed with three primary goals:

- High-quality image generation
- Modular workflow customization
- Efficient inference and resource utilization

---
## Key Features 🚀

---

### ⚙️ Flexible Dual-Backend Architecture

---

- A streamlined **Diffusers-based backend** (powered by FastAPI) for core text-to-image tasks, using a **custom-pruned SDXL model** optimized for speed and performance.
- A powerful **ComfyUI backend** dedicated to advanced image manipulation, inpainting, and the virtual try-on pipeline.

---

### 🧠 Advanced Virtual Try-On & Inpainting Pipeline

---

- Built on the high-performance **FLUX** model for efficient and realistic manipulations.
- Features a **multi-stage inpainting process** that:
  - Intelligently crops the image
  - Seamlessly stitches it back into the original
- Includes **automated precision masking** for accessories like watches.
- Supports **automatic hand and wrist masking** for realistic and aligned placements.
- Fully **modular and bypass-capable pipeline** allowing deep customization of the workflow.

---

### 🧩 Extensive Model & Customization Support

---

- Full support for a wide range of **LoRA models** across both backends.
- Specialized LoRAs for **text preservation** and **image enhancement** (e.g., `Ace++`, `catvton-flux-try-on`).
- **Advanced model stacking** combines:
  - Base models (fp8)
  - Style models  
  - Multiple enhancement LoRAs
- Includes a **utility workflow** for saving and reusing complex text prompts.This process uses conditioning from another workflow that replaces the dual CLIP and T5 encoders and reduces VRAM usage by 8 GB. It then masks the text area, allowing for further inpainting to improve the text on the watch.
- Integrated **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to read text from images.
- A **high-resolution upscaling stage** for sharper, more detailed outputs.

---

### 🌐 Modern & Responsive Frontend

---

- Clean, fast, and intuitive web interface built with:
  - **React**
  - **Vite**
  - **ShadCN UI**
- Designed for a seamless and responsive user experience across devices.

## Project Structure

---

## 🧩 Key Components Breakdown

---

### Backend & Workflows 🖥️

---

* **`comfui-backend`**: Contains a custom `comfy-runner` script for launching and managing the ComfyUI instance, along with utilities for downloading and organizing required models. After running the `comfy-runner` the user has to run the `models_downloading.ipynb` file which downloads the entire model. 
* **`sd-backend`**: Holds the necessary configurations and scripts for the core Stable Diffusion backend.

---
  
### Workflows 📊

---

This directory contains pre-built graphs. The star is `multipipeline_watch.json`, a complex workflow designed to generate highly detailed watches by isolating and manipulating the text on the watch face and another workflow which is `other_pipeline_final.json` which is used for other types of Try-On features different from the watch.

---

### Custom Nodes 🔌

---

This project introduces several powerful custom nodes to enhance your generative pipelines:

* **`Upscaler`**: A node for high-resolution image upscaling.
* **`PaddleOCR`**: Integrates PaddleOCR for robust text recognition directly within your workflow. Useful for reading text from generated or existing images.
* **`Handwrist Automasking`**: Automatically detects and creates masks for hands and wrists, perfect for generating realistic product placements or virtual try-ons.
* **`Conditioning`**: This technology provides advanced options for model and prompt conditioning, replacing the traditional use of CLIP and T5 to give you finer control over the output and enhance the text's influence.
* **`Watch`**: A specialized node set for watch generation:
    * **Mask Watch Face**: Precisely masks the inside circular area of a watch dial. This is essential for isolating the face to apply text or other details accurately.
* **Flux Model Optimizer**: A helper node designed to work with the watch masker, optimizing the generative process for clarity and precision on the watch face. which compiles the model and increaes in inference speed

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

EdiGen AI incorporates multiple optimizations aimed at reducing computational overhead while maintaining image quality.

| Optimization | Impact |
|-------------|---------|
| Custom Conditioning Models | ~8 GB VRAM reduction |
| FLUX Compiler | Faster inference |
| OCR-Guided Inpainting | Improved text quality |
| Multi-Stage Cropping Pipeline | Better local detail preservation |
| High-Resolution Upscaling | Sharper final outputs |

These optimizations enable complex workflows to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware while preserving professional-quality outputs.

## Setup and Usage 🛠️

---

You can choose to set up and run either the ComfyUI backend or the SD backend, depending on your needs.

### 1. Frontend Setup 🌐

To run the web interface, navigate to the `Frontend_VERCEL` directory and follow these steps:
```sh
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd Frontend_VERCEL

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. You will need to configure the backend URL in the frontend code to point to the address of your chosen backend server.

---

### 2. Backend Setup ⚙️

---

You can choose one of the two available backends.

#### Option A: ComfyUI_backend

This backend is ideal for running complex, customized workflows.

1.  **Install ComfyUI**: Follow the official [ComfyUI installation guide](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI#installing).

2.  **Install Custom Nodes**: Copy the contents of the `ComfyUI_New_NODES` directory into the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory of your ComfyUI installation.
    ```sh
    cp -r ComfyUI_New_NODES/* /ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages for the custom nodes by running:
    ```sh clone this github 
    pip install -r ComfyUI_New_NODES/ComfyUI-HandWristMask/requirements.txt
    pip install -r ComfyUI_New_NODES/Comfyui_FLUX_Optimizer/requirements.txt
    pip install -r ComfyUI_New_NODES/Comfyui_paddleocr/requirements.txt
    pip install -r ComfyUI_New_NODES/comfyui_watch/requirements.txt
    ```

4. Inside the `model-downloading/` folder, some files may contain Hugging Face URLs with a placeholder like `<your-huggingface-token>`.
🔐 Make sure to replace `<your-huggingface-token>` with your actual Hugging Face token in any scripts or config files before running them.
Example:
    ```bash
    wget --header="Authorization: Bearer <your-huggingface-token>" https://huggingface.co/your-model-url
    ```

#### Option B: SD_Backend
and in the sdxl backend file you had to put your ngrok auth token in the last cell
This backend provides a more conventional API for image generation and includes advanced features like automatic LoRA selection.

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `SD_Backend` directory and install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    cd sd-backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. **Ngrok Tunnel for Public Access**: Run the notebook and the last cell of the notebook should include your Ngrok auth token to expose the server. Replace the token provided with your own Ngrok token which can be fetched by logging in your Ngrok account:
   
Copy the generated public URL and set it in the frontend config.
